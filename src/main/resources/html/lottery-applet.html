A quick, easy, and truly random way to pick your lottery numbers - let this applet pick them for you! I wrote this Java applet as an exercise in simple animation, sorting, etc. It will pick your lottery numbers at the push of a button, so you don't have to resort to using the birthday of your budgerigar, or whatever.
<p>
If you win anything using the numbers it generates, I think it only fair for you to give me a big slice; say 75%. What do you mean "No"? I did all the hard work, all you did was push a button! Alright then, 50%, but that's my final offer...
